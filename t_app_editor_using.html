<p>When you install a new app, the <span class="ph uicontrol">Hello World</span> development tab that includes
the editor is added to the Console, and a second tab shows the <span class="ph uicontrol">Hello World</span>
app in normal installed mode without the editor.</p>

<p>The following diagram shows the first <span class="ph uicontrol">Hello World </span> app tab without the
editor, and the <span class="ph uicontrol">Hello World - Custom Tab Development</span> tab that includes the
editor on <span class="ph">QRadar</span>. </p>

such as editing the manifest or other files, you deploy and upgrade the app in development mode to
apply your changes. The app version in the manifest file increments when you deploy an
app.</p>
<p>When you deploy your app in development mode, you have the option to save a copy of the
current app in <span class="ph filepath">.zip</span> format.</p>

app <span class="ph uicontrol"> in Live Mode</span>, it's good practice to save your app locally, otherwise you
can't access your changes after the app is deployed because the editor tab is removed.</p>
<p>The
development mode tab that includes the App Editor is removed from the Console when you deploy the
app <span class="ph uicontrol"> in Live Mode</span>. If you want to edit the app again, you must export it as a
<span class="ph filepath">.zip</span> file so that you can import it to <span class="ph">QRadar</span> and edit it at a later
time.</p>

(<span class="ph filepath">.zip</span>) file, which you can import as an existing app later. The
<span class="ph filepath">.zip</span> file that you export is not an app extension that can be installed by
using the <span class="ph uicontrol">Extensions Management</span> tool on the <span class="ph uicontrol">Admin</span> tab.
</p>
<p>When you export the app, the app version in the manifest displays in the export dialog box.
When you change the version that appears in the export dialog box, the app version in the manifest
file version is changed to the same version.</p>

<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> If you make changes to the app, ensure that you export the app so that your changes are saved
in the exported zip file and you can install the app again later. The <span class="ph menucascade"><span class="ph uicontrol">File</span><abbr title="and then"> &gt; </abbr><span class="ph uicontrol"> Save</span></span> function saves the session only in QRadar, and does not write to the compressed file,
